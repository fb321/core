### Known Issues

The current known issues are as follows:

- Applications using Console System Service should be regenerated by reconfiguring the Console System Service in MHC Project Graph.

- Applications using the FreeRTOS component must be regenerated by removing and adding the FreeRTOS component again in MHC Project Graph.

- Flash wait states are now calculated as part of respective flash PLIB (EFC/NVMCTRL) instead of clock manager for SAM microcontrollers. Older projects must be reconfigured to add the respective Flash PLIB to the MHC Project Graph.

- Timer System Services is only supported with Coretimer PLIB on PIC32M devices.

- ATSAMA5D2C demo applications build with a warning message: ```Warning[Pe111]: statement is unreachable for return ( EXIT_FAILURE ); statement of main() in IAR```
