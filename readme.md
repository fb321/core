This repository contains the core module for the MPLAB® Harmony 3 Embedded
Software Development Framework.  The core module components provide drivers
and services with simple to use abstractions of peripherals and shared
resources on Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC devices on which MPLAB Harmony
applications and middleware are based.  Drivers and services may also provide
advanced capabilities like buffer queuing and peripheral sharing.  Refer to
the following links for release notes, training materials, and interface
reference information.
